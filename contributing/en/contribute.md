# Contribute

PKP software documentation is created and maintained by PKP staff, users, and developers. It’s coordinated by the Documentation Interest Group (DIG), which is made up of PKP staff, users, and developers who are especially interested in documentation. All of us are available to answer questions and offer assistance and guidance to other folks who want to contribute to documentation.  

We communicate via an email list and meet twice a month for 2-hour virtual documentation sprints, where we collaborate virtually on documentation.  

If you want to get involved with documentation, email [documentation@publicknowledgeproject.org](mailto:documentation@publicknowledgeproject.org).

### Ways to Contribute to PKP Documentation

There many ways to contribute to PKP software documentation whether you want to write, edit, or update any piece – big or small – of a specific document.

1. **Update existing documentation** // Most PKP software is consistently under development. Documentation requires the same. Depending on how much the software has changed since the last revision, updating documentation can involve making a few minor changes or significant rewriting. A list of documents flagged for an update is on the PKP Documentation Tasks spreadsheet, explained below. If you are new to writing documentation, updating docs is often a good place to start.

2. **Transform support forum topics into documentation** // One way that PKP provides support to users, in addition to documentation, is by hosting a [support forum](https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/). Users post questions about the software on the forum and members of the PKP staff and community answer the questions. The support forum is a rich resource for unique, advanced information for customizations and troubleshooting the software which may be missing from the standard documentation, especially regarding new features. It can be difficult, however, to find relevant information on the forum. You can contribute to PKP documentation by noting questions on the forum that are not answered in documentation (especially common questions) and transferring the answers to existing documentation or sometimes creating new documentation.

3. **Contribute new documentation** // This can include a whole document on how to use a plugin or software tool, or it could just be writing a chapter or section in a larger document, but it means creating original documentation. To do this, you should have a solid understanding of the tool or feature for which you are writing instructions. We have a list of desired documentation, or you may wish to contribute your own. Instructions on how to access the list and format guidelines are available below.

4. **Review and edit** // When PKP documentation has been created or updated, it goes through a review process, in which someone reads it and offers critical feedback on accuracy, clarity, and completeness. If you enjoy proofreading or editing or are new to documentation, this could be the right task for you. The PKP Documentation Tasks spreadsheet (explained below) has labels for which docs need review.

5. **Translate** // PKP software users live all over the world and speak many different languages. PKP software has been translated into [over 35 languages](https://pkp.sfu.ca/developers/translation/). Most PKP software documentation is written in English initially and needs translation into other languages. If you are a fluent reader of English and fluent writer of another language, translating documentation into the other language is a valuable contribution to the documentation project. <!-- note here on how translations are managed -->

6. **Make an instructional video or screencast** // PKP has a set of videos called [PKP School](https://pkpschool.sfu.ca/) on how to use OJS and contribute to OJS journals, and we are building a collection of other videos about PKP software. If you’re interested in making video tutorials on using PKP software, you can volunteer to help make PKP School videos, or you can make your own video on how to carry out a task or set of tasks in one of the PKP software tools. To assist with PKP School videos, contact Kevin Stranack at kstranac@sfu.ca. Guidelines for making videos are below.

7. **Share your local documentation with the PKP user community** // Have you made a document about PKP software that is specific to your local institution, journal, conference, or press? It may be useful to the broader PKP user community if it provides information and instructions not available elsewhere or if other users are looking for examples of institutional or journal-specific documentation.  We are building a collection of external documentation. To add to it, please contact [documentation@publicknowledgeproject.org](mailto:documentation@publicknowledgeproject.org).

8. **Identify documentation that is missing or needs improvement** // If you notice something that there should be documentation for or existing documentation that needs to be corrected, updated, or explained more clearly, we want to know. You can send your suggestion to [documentation@publicknowledgeproject.org](mailto:documentation@publicknowledgeproject.org), file an issue in the [Github PKP Docs repository](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-docs), or click the *Improve this page* link on any document in the Documentation Hub. To file an issue in the repository, you first have to create a Github account and sign in. 

Members of the Documentation Interest Group review suggestions regularly and add them to lists of potential tasks. Please provide as much detail as possible in your suggestion.

### Find a Documentation Task to Do

PKP keeps track of documentation that needs to be created, updated, and reviewed on a [shared spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bo0etXPjDxC_xdmOGCdwAtdXv85ojdqRdNr3sfMD2aU/) that's maintained by the DIG. If you're looking for a documentation task to do, the spreadsheet is an excellent place to start. You can also add new tasks.  

Tasks are categorized by role and listed on different worksheets according to role. You can look for tasks that match your role or background with PKP software. The roles are as follows:

- Administrators: Administrators are responsible for PKP software installation and upgrades, ensuring the server settings are accurate, adding language files, and creating any new journals on the installation. Administrators have an understanding of and may modify system files and settings, but are not responsible for programming new features or developing the software.
- Developers: Developers participate in the development of PKP software applications and plugins. They write and modify the code and evaluate and implement new features.
- Application Users: Application Users represent end users of PKP software in a variety of different roles, including Journal Manager, Press Manager, Conference Manager, Editor, Reviewer, Author, Copyeditor, and Subscription Manager. They configure settings in the software applications but do not modify system files.
- Other: Documentation tasks that are not specific to one of the above roles are added to this sheet.

For each task you can see the following information:

- Topic, Description, and Notes explain the content of the documentation that needs to be created or updated. Read these to see what you should include and any relevant background information.
- Action Needed indicates whether the documentation needs to be created from scratch, updated, reviewed, maintained, or moved 
- Status notes whether the documentation is not started, in progress, or complete. Look for a task that is not started yet or one that is in progress that you want to assist with.
- If the documentation needs to be added to an existing document or an existing document needs to be edited, the document name will be included in the Add to/Part of column and the URL for the document will be included in the New URL column.

### Sign up for a task

1. Select a task based on your role, interests, and experience with PKP software.  
2. Email the DIG at [documentation@publicknowledgeproject.org](mailto:documentation@publicknowledgeproject.org) to tell them what task you want to do. The DIG will update the spreadsheet with the information you send. This will ensure that 2 people don’t work on the same task and that you get all the information and resources you need for the task. Include the following information in your message:
	- A description of the task you’re going to do
	- Your name and contact information 
	- The date you plan to finish the task
	- Any questions you have about the task or process 
3. If you have questions or need help while you’re working on your task, you can email documentation@publicknowledgeproject.org, post on the PKP Documentation Slack channel or email list, or attend a virtual documentation sprint.
4. Once your documentation task is complete, submit it to the DIG in an appropriate format, following the instructions in this guide. If the deadline passes the DIG may contact you to ask how the task is going.
